Aleix Bassolas is a physicst interested in the study of complex systems focusing mainly on the various aspects of urban systems and human mobility. Currently he is a postdoctoral researcher at the Departament d'Enginyeria Informàtica i Matèmatiques from the Universitat Rovira i Virgili. His current research focuses on the development of novel methods and models to understand the emergence of congestion and its multifaceted impact in the livability of cities. From a theoretical perspective, on the role of node and link metadata in complex networks.

He obtained his PhD in Physics at the IFISC (Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems) in Mallorca (Spain) under the supervision of José Javier Ramasco. His research focused on the modelling of public transportation, the impact of public policies in congestion or how the organization of cities impacts their livability, among others. He also worked as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the School of Mathematics, Queen Mary University of London, where he developed novel approaches to the study of node metadata in complex networks.
