abstract: Trip distribution laws are basic for the travel demand
  characterization needed in transport and urban planning. Several approaches
  have been considered in the last years. One of them is the so-called gravity
  law, in which the number of trips is assumed to be related to the population
  at origin and destination and to decrease with the distance. The mathematical
  expression of this law resembles Newton's law of gravity, which explains its
  name. Another popular approach is inspired by the theory of intervening
  opportunities which argues that the distance has no effect on the destination
  choice, playing only the role of a surrogate for the number of intervening
  opportunities between them. In this paper, we perform a thorough comparison
  between these two approaches in their ability at estimating commuting flows by
  testing them against empirical trip data at different scales and coming from
  different countries. Different versions of the gravity and the intervening
  opportunities laws, including the recently proposed radiation law, are used to
  estimate the probability that an individual has to commute from one unit to
  another, called trip distribution law. Based on these probability distribution
  laws, the commuting networks are simulated with different trip distribution
  models. We show that the gravity law performs better than the intervening
  opportunities laws to estimate the commuting flows, to preserve the structure
  of the network and to fit the commuting distance distribution although it
  fails at predicting commuting flows at large distances. Finally, we show that
  the different approaches can be used in the absence of detailed data for
  calibration since their only parameter depends only on the scale of the
  geographic unit.
