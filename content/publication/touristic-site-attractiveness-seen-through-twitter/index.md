abstract: Tourism is becoming a significant contributor to medium and long range
  travels in an increasingly globalized world. Leisure traveling has an
  important impact on the local and global economy as well as on the
  environment. The study of touristic trips is thus raising a considerable
  interest. In this work, we apply a method to assess the attractiveness of 20
  of the most popular touristic sites worldwide using geolocated tweets as a
  proxy for human mobility. We first rank the touristic sites based on the
  spatial distribution of the visitors’ place of residence. The Taj Mahal, the
  Pisa Tower and the Eiffel Tower appear consistently in the top 5 in these
  rankings. We then pass to a coarser scale and classify the travelers by
  country of residence. Touristic site’s visiting figures are then studied by
  country of residence showing that the Eiffel Tower, Times Square and the
  London Tower welcome the majority of the visitors of each country. Finally, we
  build a network linking sites whenever a user has been detected in more than
  one site. This allow us to unveil relations between touristic sites and find
  which ones are more tightly interconnected.
