abstract: The recent trend of rapid urbanization makes it imperative to
  understand urban characteristics such as infrastructure, population
  distribution, jobs, and services that play a key role in urban livability and
  sustainability. A healthy debate exists on what constitutes optimal structure
  regarding livability in cities, interpolating, for instance, between mono- and
  poly-centric organization. Here anonymous and aggregated flows generated from
  three hundred million users, opted-in to Location History, are used to extract
  global Intra-urban trips. We develop a metric that allows us to classify
  cities and to establish a connection between mobility organization and key
  urban indicators. We demonstrate that cities with strong hierarchical mobility
  structure display an extensive use of public transport, higher levels of
  walkability, lower pollutant emissions per capita and better health
  indicators. Our framework outperforms previous metrics, is highly scalable and
  can be deployed with little cost, even in areas without resources for
  traditional data collection.
