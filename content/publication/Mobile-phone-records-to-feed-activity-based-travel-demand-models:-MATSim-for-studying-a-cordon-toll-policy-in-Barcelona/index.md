abstract: "Activity-based models appeared as an answer to the limitations of the
  traditional trip-based and tour-based four-stage models. The fundamental
  assumption of activity-based models is that travel demand is originated from
  people performing their daily activities. This is why they include a
  consistent representation of time, of the persons and households,
  time-dependent routing, and microsimulation of travel demand and traffic. In
  spite of their potential to simulate traffic demand management policies, their
  practical application is still limited. One of the main reasons is that these
  models require a huge amount of very detailed input data hard to get with
  surveys. However, the pervasive use of mobile devices has brought a valuable
  new source of data. The work presented here has a twofold objective: first, to
  demonstrate the capability of mobile phone records to feed activity-based
  transport models, and, second, to assert the advantages of using
  activity-based models to estimate the effects of traffic demand management
  policies. Activity diaries for the metropolitan area of Barcelona are
  reconstructed from mobile phone records. This information is then employed as
  input for building a transport MATSim model of the city. The model calibration
  and validation process proves the quality of the activity diaries obtained.
  The possible impacts of a cordon toll policy applied to two different areas of
  the city and at different times of the day are then studied. Our results show
  the way in which the modal share is modified in each of the considered
  scenarios. The possibility of evaluating the effects of the policy at both
  aggregated and traveller level, together with the ability of the model to
  capture policy impacts beyond the cordon toll area confirm the advantages of
  activity-based models for the evaluation of traffic demand management
  policies."
